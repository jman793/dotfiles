# Dotfiles

My configuration files for bash, vim, tmux and so forth.

# Setup Notes

The intention is to be able to run  a setup script after cloning the repo on a Mac system and be up and running very quickly.

Mac Setup
```bash 
cd $HOME
mkdir $HOME/REPOS
git clone https://github.com/jman793/dotfiles.git
cd $HOME/REPOS/dotfiles
source setup
```
